## Run the Project 
Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and run by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./mpc

## About the Project 
1) The vehicle model 
- I used kinematic model. In this project, I ignored the tire forces, gravity, vehicle mass to simplify the model. Even though it reduces the accuracy of the model, it approximated well the actual vehicle dynamics at moderate speeds in simulator.

2) State vector and actuator
- I used 4 state vector and 2 actuators, which are x position, y postion, the angle between x-axis and vehicle's heading direction, vehicle speed, steering actuatror and throttle(brake+accel) actuator for each. This 4 state vectors and 2 actuators well approximate the vehicle's behavior in Kinematic model. Steering and throttle actuators can cover almost 90% of the vehicle's movement. (In reality, there will be other actuators such as tranmission(Gear)). I updated the 4 state with the fomulas as follows; (1) x(t+1) = x(t) + v(t)*cos(psi(t))* dt (2) y(t+1) = y(t) + v(t)*sin(psi(t))* dt (3) psi(t+1) = psi(t) + (v(t)/Lf) * delta * dt (4) v(t+1) = v(t) + a(t) * dt. Lf means the distance between the front of the vehicle and its center of gravity, it influences the degree of vehicle's turning angle. Delta stands for the steering angle.   

3) T(Total prediction time), N(Timestep length) and dt (elapsed duration between tiemstep) Value
 - Generally speaking, Large number of T and small number of dt is good. However, if T is too large, the prediction is not accurate because the vehicle environment is changed a lot within a few second. Let's assume that vehicle's average speed is 50Km/h, which means that the vehicle moves 13.8m/sec. I think that 13.8m is really long distance to predict, and I assumed T should not be longer than 1 second. In addition, if dt is too small, it requires too much computational power. So, with the trial and error approach, I found the 0.05 was the optimal value for dt. When dt is larger than 0.05, the accuracy of steering angle was relatively low, which make the sway of the vehicle. Obviously, N is 20. (0.05 second * 20 = 1 second)
 
4) Coordinate conversion 
 - In this project, the standard of global coordinate (coming from the simulator) and vehicle coordinate was different. While global coordinate uses the traditional X,Y coordinate, the vehicle's heading direction should be always parallel with X-axis at the vehicle coordinate. Please refer to below image:  
![Test image](https://github.com/KHKANG36/MPC-Project/blob/master/coord.png)
Therefore, we have to rotate the each coordinate as much as the vehicle's psi angle. There is famous point transform fomula. I just used the fomula for coordiate rotation. Because the direction of rotation is clockwise, I used the minus sign for the psi angle.  

3) actual trajectory and reference trajectory minimize 
how? predict the vehicle actual path and adjusting the control input to minimize the difference between 
that projection and reference trajectory 

optimizer to find the control inputs and minimize the cost function 
define the duration of trajectory, (T, N, dt)
define the vehicle model and constraints . vehicle model predict next positioin of 
x, y, psi, v, cte, error of psi, limitation - actuator limitation 
define the cost function 

pass current state -> model predictive controller -> optimization solver called -> return a vector of control inputs that minimize
the cost function 
this control input aplllied to the vehicle and repreat the loop 
2) Latency 
A contributing factor to latency is actuator dynamics. For example the time elapsed between when you command a steering angle to when that angle is actually achieved. This could easily be modeled by a simple dynamic system and incorporated into the vehicle model. One approach would be running a simulation using the vehicle model starting from the current state for the duration of the latency. The resulting state from the simulation is the new initial state for MPC.




I set 20, 0.05 total 50km/h (=13.8m/sec) So, 1-sec front expectation 
too much is increect. T is sould large, dt should small should be T is a couple of sec too low dt compext 
The tricky part in this project was 1)the weight of the steering difference cost. Without the weight, the change rate of steering is too high. So, I multiplied it by 1,000 weight, and the movement was smoother. 2) Latency handling. Since there was 100milisec delay between the input and response of actuator. To handle this, I initially apply the 100 milisec delay to next prediction state.   

## Discussion/Issues 
The vehicle in simulator drives pretty well up to about 50Km/h. Over the 50Km/h speed, however, the prediction is getting unstable, and the vehicle sometimes way off the road. I've tuned several parameters (such as weight, N, dt), but didn't get perfect solution. This would be future works to resolve in this project.
