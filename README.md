## MPC project for vehicle dynamics

## Run the Project 
Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and run by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./mpc

## About the Project 
1) The vehicle model 
- I used kinematic model. In this project, I ignored the tire forces, gravity, vehicle mass to simplify the model. Even though it reduces the accuracy of the model, it approximated well the actual vehicle dynamics at moderate speeds in simulator.

2) State vector and actuator
- I used 4 state vector and 2 actuators, which are x position, y postion, the angle between x-axis and vehicle's heading direction, vehicle speed, steering actuatror and throttle(brake+accel) actuator for each. This 4 state vectors and 2 actuators well approximate the vehicle's behavior in Kinematic model. Steering and throttle actuators can cover almost 90% of the vehicle's movement. (In reality, there will be other actuators such as tranmission(Gear)). I updated the 4 state with the fomulas as follows; (1) x(t+1) = x(t) + v(t) x cos(psi(t)) x dt (2) y(t+1) = y(t) + v(t) x sin(psi(t)) x dt (3) psi(t+1) = psi(t) + (v(t)/Lf) x delta x dt (4) v(t+1) = v(t) + a(t) x dt. Lf means the distance between the front of the vehicle and its center of gravity, it influences the degree of vehicle's turning angle. Delta stands for the steering angle.   

3) T(Total prediction time), N(Timestep length) and dt (elapsed duration between tiemstep) Value
 - Generally speaking, Large number of T and small number of dt is good. However, if T is too large, the prediction is not accurate because the vehicle environment is changed a lot within a few second. Let's assume that vehicle's average speed is 50Km/h, which means that the vehicle moves 13.8m/sec. I think that 13.8m is really long distance to predict, and I assumed T should not be longer than 1 second. In addition, if dt is too small, it requires too much computational power. So, with the trial and error approach, I found the 0.05 was the optimal value for dt. When dt is larger than 0.05, the accuracy of steering angle was relatively low, which make the sway of the vehicle. Obviously, N is 20. (0.05 second * 20 = 1 second)
 
4) Coordinate conversion 
 - I used the third order polynomial for the waypoints fitted to waypoints to get coefficients. Third order polynomial is enough to represent the waypoints to get coefficient. In this project, the standard of global coordinate (coming from the simulator) and vehicle coordinate was different. While global coordinate uses the traditional X,Y coordinate, the vehicle's heading direction should be always parallel with X-axis at the vehicle coordinate. Please refer to below image:  
![Test image](https://github.com/KHKANG36/MPC-Project/blob/master/coord.png)
Therefore, we have to rotate the each coordinate as much as the vehicle's psi angle. There is famous point transform fomula. I just used the fomula for coordiate rotation. Because the direction of rotation is clockwise, I used the minus sign for the psi angle.  
After the global waypoint coordinate from the simulator (ptsx, ptxy in code), calculate the difference between the coordinate and global vehicle coordinate (px,py in code). Then, I rotate it with aforementioned rotation technique, to get the vehicle's coordinate.  

5) Latency handling
There is 100ms latency in this project. It means that the time elapsed between when you command a steering angle to when that angle is actually achieved. Therefore, I calculated and transfered the predicted state after 100ms to the simulator as the new initial state. In other words, the time when actual command is achieved (after 100ms) should be the initial state. By replacing the "dt" to "delay(0.1second)" in state prediction fomulas, I could handle it easily. In addition, x(t),y(t),psi(t) value should be all zeros after coordinate conversion because the coordinate will be 0 point, 0 point, 0 angle at the vehicle's view point.  

## Discussion/Issues 
The vehicle in simulator drives pretty well up to about 50Km/h. Over the 50Km/h speed, however, the prediction is getting unstable, and the vehicle sometimes way off the road. I've tuned several parameters (such as weight, N, dt), but didn't get perfect solution. This would be future works to resolve in this project.
